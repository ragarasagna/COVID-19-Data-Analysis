# Project Description:
The primary dataset is COVID-19 Hospitalization and the testing data in California state, county-wise. The secondary data set is about the community level by county.  

Covid-19 in the United States as a whole data on hospitalization administration and equity at the county level. The dataset includes all the data from the year 2022, starting from January to date (09/06/2022). This dataset has the data of covid patients categorized into hospitalized confirmed patients, hospitalized suspected patients, hospitalized covid patients, all hospitalized beds ICU suspected Covid patients, and the number of beds available. 

The Secondary data deals with the Covid-19 infection at the community level by county in the state of California, this data has the following data in the columns named county, country_flips, state, county_population, health_serive_number, health_service_area, health_service_area_population, covid_inpatient_bed_utilization, covid_hospital_admission_per_100k, covid_cases_for_100k, Covid_19_community_level, date_updated. 

Using the above datasets, we will work on determining which counties are affected by covid-19 and categorize them into high impact, medium impact, and low impact and find the potential reasons behind them.

# Objective:
Data will be visualized to assist us in comprehending the total number of persons admitted to hospitals due to COVID-19, as well as identifying the Covid-19 hotpots by categorizing the counties based on the level of infection in that county.

# Hypothesis:
<ul>
  <li> Are the number of covid cases per 100k for Santa Clara is higher than San Diego due to higher population in San Diego County. </li>
  <li> Is the hospitalization more in Ventura as compared to Riverside because of the population difference in both the counties </li>
  <li> Whether the number of beds are more because the population in the county is more and does provision of health services affect availability of beds. </li>
  <li> Are the ICU patients available more in Ventura as compared to San Fransico based on the health care services provided </li>
  <li> Is the community level for San Benito better than San Joaquin because of the health benefits provided in that area </li>
</ul>

# Data Sources:

Secondary Dataset: https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Community-Levels-by-County/3nnm-4jni/data 

# Number of Records: 
Here, we plan on dealing with 10 different counties – Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and Ventura for the year 2022.

Primary DataSet: Columns: 9, Rows: 2550

Secondary DataSet: Columns: 12, Rows: 300

# Visualization Tool: 
The visualization tool we will be using is Tableau. It is a high-level data visualization tool that produces excellent and interactive dashboard reports that provide more insights than those created using spreadsheets or other tools. It is easy to implement and use with large datasets. 

# Data Cleansing Tool: 
Microsoft Excel is the Data Cleansing tool we will be using. It is a simple and powerful tool that everyone is familiar with. Moreover, data can be loaded from multiple sources, processed, and transformed. It does not require much coding and is relatively straightforward.
